          Based in Destin, Florida, Dcomforters' Kitchen is a family owned
          Nigerian Restaurant, focused not only on serving but also providing excellent experience
          to our prestigious customers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our chefs draw inspiration from Nigerian, Western African, and Intercontinental dishes
          and have a menu of about 10 items that they rotate seasonally.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kitchen has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
          prices, making it a go-to place for a meal any time of the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dcomforters' Kitchen is owned by a Nigerian couple, Israel and Precious, who
          moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of providing excellent
          services to the world around them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to remain at the forefront of providing excellent services to everyone who comes 
          visiting us and ensure that they have an experience that is beyond just suppressing their hunger
          with a meal.
